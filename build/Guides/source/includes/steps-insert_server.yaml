  Now you are ready to insert your first data into MongoDB.
  MongoDB uses JSON documents to populate the database,
  which are stored internally as BSON, a binary form of JSON. JSON stands
  for JavaScript Object Notation, and it's a great way to
  store rich data.
  
  The data is stored in a kind of table called
  a collection. Like SQL tables, you can have many collections
  in a database.
