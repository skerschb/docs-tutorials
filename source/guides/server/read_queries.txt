   result_description:

      In the first :doc:`/guides/server/read` guide, you retrieved a
      document from the ``inventory`` collection. In this guide, you
      will:
      
      - use the ``insertMany`` command to insert more documents into the collection
      - query the documents

     Import Data and Query It
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     In the first part of this guide, you will retrieve documents from MongoDB using a simple query
     document.
     
     .. include:: /includes/steps/read_server_query.rst
     
     
     Query Data Using Embedded Documents as Criteria
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     
     Now that you have an understanding of how to retrieve data using query documents, you will now
     query against embedded documents.
     
     .. include:: /includes/steps/read_embedded.rst
     
     Query Data Using Embedded Documents With Dot Notation
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     
     Now you will explore how to query embedded documents using ``dot notation``.
     
     .. include:: /includes/steps/read_embedded_dot.rst
     
   summary:
     If you have successfully completed this guide, you have retrieved data from MongoDB
     using specific criteria as expressed in MongoDB's query syntax. You have also used
     the embedded document query syntax to retrieve documents based on embedded fields.
