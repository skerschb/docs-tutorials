title: Create or Login To An Atlas User Account

  Atlas is MongoDB's cloud-based, database-as-a-service solution.
  In order to use MongoDB in the cloud, you need to create an Atlas user account.
  
  Go to `cloud.mongodb.com
  <https://cloud.mongodb.com/user#/atlas/login>`_ to create or login to
  your user account.
  
  If you are creating your user account, as part of the process Atlas automatically creates 
  a default :doc:`organization and project
  </organizations-projects>` for you to deploy your first cluster. You
  can add additional :doc:`organizations </tutorial/manage-organizations>` and
  :doc:`projects </tutorial/manage-projects>` later.

  If you wish to use the free tier or M0 tier (which is recommended for development only), 
  make sure you have selected the ``FREE`` or ``MO`` instance size. Note you can only
  create one free tier cluster per account.
  
  If you do not see ``M0`` as an option, ensure that the ``Cloud Provider
  and Region`` dropdowns have ``Amazon Web Services`` and either ``N. Virginia
  (us-east-1)`` or ``Frankfurt (eu-central-1)`` selected.
  
  Selecting anything other than the free tier will require you to enter in payment information
  for your cluster.
  
  .. note::
     Free tier clusters are MongoDB 3.4 instances. If you would like to use MongoDB 3.6
     you will need to use tier M2 or above.

  It takes a few minutes to build and deploy a new cluster. While you are waiting, check out

title: Create an administrative Username and Password
ref: admin-setup
level: 5
stepnum: 5
content: |
  Atlas prompts you to create an administrative MongoDB user as a part of deploying the first Atlas cluster in the project. This user has administrative access to any MongoDB cluster you deploy in the Atlas project.

  Fill in the ``username`` and ``password`` fields. The password should be random, long, and complex to ensure system security and to impede malicious access.
