  Now that you have more documents in your collection, you can retrieve specific
  documents.
  
  To specify criteria to narrow the search results, you need to pass a JSON document
  to the find() method that contains the criteria you are searching for.
  
  The following examples illustrate using a status of "D" as criteria
  for narrowing a find on a collection.
