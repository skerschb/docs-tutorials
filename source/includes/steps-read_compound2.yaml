  In the following example, the compound query document selects all

  **and** *either* ``qty`` is less than (:query:`$lt`) ``30`` *or*
  ``item`` starts with the character ``p``:

  .. include:: /includes/driver-example-query-13.rst

  .. note::

     MongoDB supports regular expressions :query:`$regex` queries to
     perform string pattern matches.

    .. code-block:: javascript
       
       {
          "_id" : ObjectId("5ab3c27c9b8f98766c10e421"),
          "item" : "Moreganic",
          "lastModified" : ISODate("2015-01-28T16:43:11.518Z"),
          "qty" : 12,
          "rating" : [
              {
                  "letter" : "A",
                  "score" : 1
              }
          ],
          "size" : {
