  In the following example, the compound query document selects all
  documents in the collection where the ``status`` equals ``"A"``
  **and** *either* ``qty`` is less than (:query:`$lt`) ``30`` *or*
  ``item`` starts with the character ``p``:

  .. include:: /includes/driver-example-query-13.rst

  .. note::

     MongoDB supports regular expressions :query:`$regex` queries to
     perform string pattern matches.

  If you have loaded data into your test database, you will see one or
  more JSON documents returned. Your results should look something like
  the JSON below. Note that the record below has a ``status`` of ``"A"``
  and a ``qty`` less than ``30`` per the criteria in the compound query. (results_read7.rst)
