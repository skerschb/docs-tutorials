  Bind to the database you wish
  to add your data to. In this case we will be using

  If you've got everything you need as defined above,
  you are ready to create your first data in MongoDB.
  
  MongoDB uses JSON documents to populate the database,
  which are stored internally as BSON, a binary form of JSON. JSON stands
  for JavaScript Object Notation, and it's a great way to
  store rich data.
  
  The data is stored in groups called collections. Like SQL tables, 
  you can have many collections in a database.
