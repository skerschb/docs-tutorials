  If you've got everything you need as defined above,
  you are ready to create your first data in MongoDB.
  
  MongoDB uses JSON documents to populate the database,
  which are stored internally as BSON, a binary form of JSON. JSON stands
  for JavaScript Object Notation, and it's a great way to
  store rich data.
  
  The data is stored in a kind of table called
  a collection. Like SQL tables, you can have many collections
  in a database.
