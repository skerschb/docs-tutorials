  To specify criteria for data that is embedded within the JSON documents, you need to pass a JSON document
  to the find() method that contains the criteria you are searching for.

  If you wish to select documents that exactly match just one of the fields in an embedded JSON object, use 
  :term:`dot notation` (``"field.nestedField"``).

  When querying using dot notation, the field and nested field must be
  inside quotation marks.
  
  The following example selects all documents where the field ``uom``
  nested in the ``size`` field equals ``"in"``:
