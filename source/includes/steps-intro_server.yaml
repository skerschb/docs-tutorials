  Decide which fields you would like to have in your database
  and how they relate to each other. For our example we are using
  an inventory database, which tracks items and their
  quantities, sizes, tags, and ratings.
  
  Here is an example of an inventory database that gives us
  some details about inventory items we are tracking.
  
  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: auto

     * - name
       - quantity
       - size
       - status
       - tags
       - ratings

     * - journal
       - 25
       - 14x21,cm
       - A
       - brown, lined
       - A, 9
       
     * - notebook
       - 50
       - 8.5x11,in
       - A
       - college-ruled,perforated
       - B, 8
       
     * - paper
       - 100
       - 8.5x11,in
       - D
       - watercolor
       - C, 10

     * - planner
       - 75
       - 22.85x30,cm
       - D
       - 2019
       - D, 10
       
     * - postcard
       - 45
       - 10x,cm
       - D
       - double-sided,white   
       - F, 2

title: Create an Example JSON message
ref: JSON_message

  While a table might seem like a good place to store data, as you can see
  from the example above, there are fields in this database that require
  multiple values and would not work well in a single column (size, tags, grades). 
  
  In a sql database you might solve this problem by creating a ``relational table``.
  
  In MongoDB data is stored as embedded data within a document, or record.
  
  In your data example, decide which fields require multiple values. These fields
  will be candidates for arrays or objects within your JSON document.
  
  For example, in the data above, size might consist of three fields:
  
  .. code-block:: javascript
  
     h: 14, w: 21, uom: "cm"
     
  And grades might be split into:

  .. code-block:: javascript
  
     letter: A, score: 9
  
  In addition, you might want to be able to handle multiple grades
  per item. So you might have the need to store a list of grades, like so:
  
  .. code-block:: javascript
  
     letter: A, score: 9,
     letter: B, score: 7,
     letter: D, score: 5

  To look at things the MongoDB way, first understand that data is stored as JSON
  documents, and not tables with columns and rows. You define these documents
  as you choose, and you can choose to provide a well-defined schema (defined data points),
  or leave your schema open to change as your application changes.
  
  A JSON document that stores an inventory item might look like
  
  .. class:: copyable-code
  .. code-block:: javascript
  
    
     {
      "name": "Bricksoil",
      "qty": 134,
      "rating": [
        {
          "letter": "A",
          "score": 7
        },
        {
          "letter": "B",
          "score": 6
        },
        {
          "letter": "C",
        "  score": 5
        },
        {
          "letter": "D",
          "score": 4
        },
        {
          "letter": "A",
          "score": 3
        },
        {
          "letter": "B",
          "score": 2
        },
        {
          "letter": "C",
          "score": 1
        }
      ],
      "size": {
        "height": 480,
        "length": 240,
        "unit": "in",
        "width": 428
      },
      "status": "C",
      "tags": [
        "messy",
        "productive"
      ]
    }
  
     
  In this JSON example, you can embed data within your data points, keeping
  the data together in one document.
