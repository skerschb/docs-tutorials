         The ``mongo`` shell is packaged with the MongoDB Server Community and Enterprise
         distributions, and is also available for users of Atlas as a client-only download.
         
         For standalone distributions (non-cloud), check in the bin directory of your
         mongodb install dir. You should see a file called ``mongo``, which is the shell
         executable.
