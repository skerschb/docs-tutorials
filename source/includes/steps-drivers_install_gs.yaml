title: Craft a URI to Connect to MongoDB
ref: connection_string
level: 4
stepnum: 2

  In order to connect to MongoDB, you will need a ``URI`` String. A
  ``URI`` (Uniform Resource Identifier) is similar to a URL, and is
  supplied as a parameter to the ``mongo`` shell, ``Compass``, and the
  MongoDB drivers in order to direct the client to connect to a MongoDB
  instance using a specific host, port, username, and in some cases,
  authentication database.
  
  Use the form below to populate the URI string.

  .. note:: The $[password] will not be replaced in the string below.
     Passwords with special characters need to be escaped [TODO]. Use
     caution where you store and enter passwords. Do not enter passwords
     in clear text on the command line.

  .. note:: If you are connecting to MongoDB in the cloud (Atlas), you'll need to
            put the ip address of the client you wish to use in the ip whitelist
            in your Atlas account. For more details see the `MongoDB in the Cloud
            Guide
