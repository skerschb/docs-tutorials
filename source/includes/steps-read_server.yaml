  If you have loaded data into your test database, you
  will see one or more JSON documents returned. If you
  loaded data similar to that outlined in the `Insert Getting
  Started Guide <http://link>`__, your results should look something like:
  
  .. code-block:: javascript
  
       { "_id" : ObjectId("5a9854915c8eb0d368732649"), 
         "item" : "canvas", 
         "qty" : 100, 
         "tags" : [ "cotton" ], 
         "size" : { 
                     "h" : 28, 
                     "w" : 35.5, 
                     "uom" : "cm" 
                  }
